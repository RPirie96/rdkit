# Getting Started with Contributing to the RDKit

We are really happy to have new contributors help make the RDKit better. This document aims to provide an in-depth overview of what and how to make useful contributions to the RDKit community. 

## What and How to Contribute

### If you are not a developer

Really helpful things you can do that don't involve serious coding:

- Being an active part of the community and asking/answering questions on Github
- Submitting high-quality bug reports via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/issues)
- Contributing documentation
    - Fixing pieces you find to be unclear or wrong
    - Adding references where available 
    - Adding new sections or examples
    - In-code documentation: comments explaining what the code does or references
    - This Getting Started guide! 
- Contributing tutorials
- Ideas for improvements 
- Write blog posts (either your own or for the [RDKit blog](https://greglandrum.github.io/rdkit-blog/))

#### GitHub Issues vs Discussions
If you have a question about the RDKit or aren't sure if what you're seeing is the right behavior please use the Discussions tab (https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/discussions) instead of posting it as an issue. Most of the time the unexpected behaviour is an issue from your side. 
If you have a suggestion for a new RDKit feature or enhancement please consider starting a discussion about it using the Discussions tab before creating a feature request. Community input on how a feature could work is often helpful and it could be that there's already a way to do what you want to do in the RDKit.

If you are sure that what you're seeing is wrong behaviour, please use the template below as it will help understand the underlying bug report. If you do not provide the information requested we may not be able to help you and will probably close the issue. Issues should be reported to https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/issues.
It is also possible to report a report a vulnerability at https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/security/advisories/.
This submission will only be viewable to repository maintainers and you will be credited if the advisory is published.

### If you are a developer

It’s generally a good idea to check with Greg or one of the maintainers before adding significant new functionality.
