# Getting Started with Contributing to the RDKit

## What and How to Contribute

## Contributing to the RDKit Docs 

## Contributing to the Code - Python 

This guide already assumes that you are familiar with [the rdkit basics](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html), version control with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and GitHub features such as commits and pull requests. If not, there is a very [neat presentation from UGM 2016](https://github.com/rdkit/UGM_2016/blob/master/Presentations/Landrum_Schneider_GitHub_Git_and_RDKit.pdf) that you should definitely look at before you start.


### Setting up your Environment

Wim summarizes and links whatever is here: https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/issues/3052


### Coding Style

RDKit does not at the moment has a dedicated style guide or a linter that you should use. However, there are a few rules that you might want to adhere to so that the code and API design stays coherent:

- use **camel case** for **ModuleNames**, "ClassNames", "MethodNames"
