# Getting Started with Contributing to the RDKit

We are really happy to have new contributors help make the RDKit better. This document aims to provide an in-depth overview of what and how to make useful contributions to the RDKit community. 

## What and How to Contribute

### If you are not a developer

Really helpful things you can do that don't involve serious coding:

- Being an active part of the community and asking/answering questions on Github
- Submitting high-quality bug reports via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/issues)
- Contributing documentation
    - Fixing pieces you find to be unclear or wrong
    - Adding references where available 
    - Adding new sections or examples
    - In-code documentation: comments explaining what the code does or references
    - This Getting Started guide! 
- Contributing tutorials
- Ideas for improvements 
- Write blog posts (either your own or for the [RDKit blog](https://greglandrum.github.io/rdkit-blog/))
